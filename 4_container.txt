Defination:-

A container is a standard unit of software that packages up code and all its dependencies so the application runs quickly and reliably from one computing environment to another. 
A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings. 
Container images become containers at runtime and in the case of Docker containers - images become containers when they run on Docker Engine. Available for both Linux and Windows-based applications, containerized software will always run the same, regardless of the infrastructure. 
Containers isolate software from its environment and ensure that it works uniformly despite differences for instance between development and staging


Show all container(running/stop):-
docker ps -a

Create a new container:-
syntax-docker run -it --name container name image name:version  

Example:-docker run -it --name myos1 centos:7
	
Stop a running container:-
Syntax- docker stop container name
Example- docker stop myos1

Exit from a container and return to base os(RHEL8)
exit 

Remove a container 
Syntax-docker rm container name 
Example-docker rm myos1
